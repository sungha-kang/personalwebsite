                    <p>Hi! My name is Sungha, and I'm a current Master's Student studying Library and Information Science at the University of Washington. 
                        During my undergraduate years, I double-majored in Library and Information Science and Statistics at SKKU. 
                    </p>
                    <p>I am drawn to studying how people interact with misinformation, form opinions, and confirm beliefs within social media and online communities.
                        My ultimate goal is to help create online spaces that are safe and inclusive, 
                        minimizing misinformation and harmful content whilst promoting mutual support, constructive dialogue, and engagement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to my studies, I have been working as a metadata researcher in various organizations since 2021. 
                        I am passionate about making data more FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) 
                        and contributing to a more structured and transparent data ecosystem.
                    </p>
                    <p>Outside of my academic journey, I enjoy cooking, binge-watching movies, and listening to House, Techno, and R&B music.
                        Please feel free to reach out to me at my email if you have any questions!
                    </p>
